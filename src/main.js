    but because simply writing a contextless dillx variable will make rollup
    treat it as separate to anywhere that dillx is actually imported.

    Case in point, rollup converts the default export that is 'dillx' to 'main',
    'dillx' will be undefined if it is not imported. If dillx is imported and then
    not used VSCode will grey it out.
    dillx() is not actually used and is not a Function and so it should be removed.
